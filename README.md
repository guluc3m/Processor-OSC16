The objective of this proyect was to create a soft-processor for a FPGA, made to be simple enough to be undertanded by
anyone with a basic knowledge of the operation of a processor.
The project was developed with the VHDL language on Quartus Prime, and was tested on a Cyclone IV FPGA with an arduino as a memory simulator.
The processor was designed from scratch and programmed in the FPGA using VHDL, a RISC-based instruction set for the processor was also developed.

This project was mainly thought to create an open-source design of a processor and make this knowledge free.

--BUG REPORT--
--- DATE ---- SUMMARY ----
    14/10/20  Automatically add the segment to the address bus with small adders to increase process by 2 steps, so the segment bus should be deleted
    14/10/20  Automatically set the EIR(31 downto 0) to the address to jump if interrupt occurs, to first execute the BRK instruction and then jumps to EIR(31 downto 0), or how?
    14/10/20  Reduce the EIR to 32bits
    14/10/20  Make availble the addrres inmediate value, and the address immediate + segment //Decidida
    17/10/20  Memory interface to solve roblems about variable size on external memory, to be able to access 8bits up to ???bits, allowing reads while executing a instruction //Modular mas tarde
    19/10/20  Repetitions register that makes the processor repeat the last instruction up until the rgister is 0. Flag to save if this register is used //Mas tarde
    19/10/20  Reduce the EIR to 16bits?, no because of an address?
    19/10/20  Use the falling edge of the clock for the second impulse instead of other clock //Hacer
    19/10/20  The memory interface has direct connection registers to allow the cpu to request readings and then allow the processor to know if the reading are already perforemed if they are not and the next cycle needs the memory reading the processor will wait until the address reading is performed //Depende de la ram
